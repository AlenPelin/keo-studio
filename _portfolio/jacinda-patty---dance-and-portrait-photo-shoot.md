Do you want to do dance photo shoot or relaxed portrait photoshoot on the fancy streets of Melbourne? Book me, keo studio photography!

If you ask me how did I meet Jacinda the answer would be "I don't know". Funny, but there was a magical coincidence. I was looking for a model on the Instagram and I found a very good one; I checked her feed and saw another beautiful girl who loves to dance. It was Jacinda.

I messaged her without any hope she will text me back (it happens because most of the people doesn't read direct messages in Instagram) ut she did and we agreed to take some photos out there, on fancy streets of Fitzroy and Collingwood.

Then I found out that Jacinda was preparing for her physical theatre show "Boxed in Sideways" by Three Feet Rising during the Melbourne Fringe Festival.
