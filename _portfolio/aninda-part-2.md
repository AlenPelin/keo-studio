My work as a photographer in Melbourne is full of not only photo sessions but post processing and photo retouching too.

Every time I take 400 ish photos (sometimes, it more then 700 or even 1000, for example, when I do event photography in Melbourne or cake smash photography or lookbooks (catalogs) in Melbourne) and, after a photo session I need to go thgrough them and decide which ones should I edit and give to my clients.

Believe me, you don't need 200 almost identical photos; you will be bored very soon. You need 20-50 astounishingly good photos maximum.

So, in the middle of "editing" week I cought myself on a thought "I want to do a quick fashion photography session in Melbourne CBD"

I checked my models and Aninda was available to collaborate. We decided to do 2 simple, a little bit grange looks on busy melburnian streets.

<p>I wanted to recreate style of melburnian street style bloggers and we nailed it!
