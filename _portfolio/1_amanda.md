I meet Amanda when I was looking for a new start for keo studio photography in Melbourne. I wanted to do more fashion photography, street style photography and try myself in model tests for melbournian (but not limited to) models, and Amanda was absolutely perfect person for that. We took a lot of photos disregard of uncomfy weather.

I am extremely happy with the result. I love natural light photosessions more then studio photography disregard the fact the natural light is more unpredictable and unstable then artificial light in studio.

We even try to do very popular photos as neon light photos the other day! I am going to show the neon light photo shoot later, I promise.
