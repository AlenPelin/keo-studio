I meet Amanda when I was looking for a new start of keo studio photography.
I wanted to do more fashiony streetstyle photography and Amanda was absolutely perfect model for that.
We took a lot of photos disregard of uncomfy weather. We even try to do very popular photos as neon light photos.
I am extremely happy with the result.
