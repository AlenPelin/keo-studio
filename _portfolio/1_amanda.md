I meet Amanda when I was looking for a new start for keo studio photography in Melbourne. I wanted to do more fashion photography, street style photography and try myself in model tests for melbournian (but not limited to) models, and Amanda was absolutely perfect person for that. We took a lot of photos disregard of uncomfy weather. 

We even try to do very popular photos as neon light photos.  At the end of the neon light photosession in the Melbournne CBD I am extremely happy with the result.
