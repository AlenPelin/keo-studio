in January 2018, I decided to try something new for keo studio photography; my first decision was to do steps in direction to street style photography, fashion photography and lookbooks for australian fashion brands (small and big).

There are a lot of opportunities to do so in Melbourne, where we have [Melbourne Fashion Week (MFW)](https://mfw.melbourne.vic.gov.au/about/) and many many talented bloggers, stylist, designers and influencers. And photographers.

Aninda was a perfect model for me. Can you believe that it was her first photo session as a model? She nailed it! We did one look in different location in Melbourne city and I would like to share some photos with you.

I am going to do more fashion photography in Melbourne and in Australia because I really like it. I like the posing and the balance between clothes and models.
