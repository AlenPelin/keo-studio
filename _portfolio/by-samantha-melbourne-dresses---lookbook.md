I don't remember how I found Samantha. Probably, it was on Instagram; I surfed on it for an inspiration and I found the post about creative and talented women of Melbourne.After that I saw Samantha on Designers Expo in Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne and I was so inspired by he and her dresses! She is so energetic and talented woman!

By the way, I messaged her about my feelings and offered my service as a photographer at any time. And after that she asked me to take some photos of her new dresses in street style photography. We finished with very romantic and relaxed lookbook photoshoot. I am absolutely thrilled how it all turned out! I live colors and how they matched with the dresses. The light was beautiful.

I was so happy to work with Samantha and her brand! It was so good to create something good together. Hope to collaborate with her in a nearest future.
