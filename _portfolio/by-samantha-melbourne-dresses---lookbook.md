I don't remember how I found Samantha. Probably, it was on Instagram; I surfed on it, looking for an inspiration and I found the post about women in art of Melbourne. I was so inspired by Samantha and her dresses! She is so energetic and talented woman!

By the way, I messaged her about my feelings and offered my service as a photographer at any time. And after that she asked me to take some photos of her new dresses. It should be street style photography or relaxed lookbook photography job.

I was so happy to work with Samantha and her brand! It was so good to create something good together. Hope to collaborate with her in a nearest future.
