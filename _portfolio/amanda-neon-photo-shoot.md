Have you ever heard about neon light portrait photography? It is a very popular theme for a photo shoot. I would say that neon photoshoot is a followers-magnet! 

I already show you a [photo shoot with Amanda](https://www.keo-studio.com/portfolio/1_amanda/). And I was so happy when, after I shared my neon photo shoot ideas, she told me she was thinking about it too and she would love to work with me! We called it a day!

We were quite limited in time:

* You need to wait until dusk before you can start taking neon sign photos. 
* The very popular place in Melbourne was chosen for that.
* It was a really, REALLY cold night in Melbourne and thanks to brave Amanda
