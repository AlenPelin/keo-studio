<p>Hi!</p>

<p> I am Svetlana <i>*you can call me Lana.</i> I am fashion and portrait photographer based in Melbourne, Australia.</p>

<p>I started building my portfolio in 2014, when I moved to Australia; it all started as a part of my English classes (you can't direct your model without proper language, right?) but now I can not imagine my life without photography.</p>

<p>I started from a scratch; now I have a big portfolio with fine art portraits, families and engagements; I participated in different projects and I do retouching job.</p>

<p>Now I tend to do fashion photography, street style photography and model tests.</p>
