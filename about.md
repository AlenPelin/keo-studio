Hi!

I am Svetlana <i>*you can call me Lana.</i> I am fashion and portrait photographer based in Melbourne, Australia.

I started building my portfolio in 2014, when I moved to Australia; it all started as a part of my English classes (you can't direct your model without proper language, right?) but now I can not imagine my life without photography.

I started from a scratch; now I have a big portfolio with fine art portraits, families and engagements; I participated in different projects and I do retouching job.

Now I tend to do fashion photography, street style photography and model tests.
